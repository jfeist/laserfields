Documentation
-------------
Sample input files are in [test](https://github.com/jfeist/laserfields/tree/master/test),
while [programs](https://github.com/jfeist/laserfields/tree/master/programs)
contains small programs using the library.
For new users, [programs/test_laserfields.f90](https://github.com/jfeist/laserfields/tree/master/programs/test_laserfields.f90)
is probably a good starting point to see how to use the library.

In addition, documentation of the source code (autogenerated with doxygen) can be found 
at http://jfeist.github.com/laserfields. Rewriting the comments in the source code to make this more
useful is an ongoing task.
